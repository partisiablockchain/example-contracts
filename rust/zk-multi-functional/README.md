# Zero knowledge: Multi-functional

Example contract shows how to support multiple Zero Knowledge functions. 

The two supported functions:

- Produce and open a secret-shared 4.
- Produce and open identity of some input. Somewhat similar to
  `zk-immediate-open`.

The latest opened value will be stored in the contract state.
