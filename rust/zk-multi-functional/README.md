# PBC Rust ZK: Multi-functional

This simple contract shows how to support multiple ZK functions. The two
supported functions:

- Produce and open a secret-shared 4.
- Produce and open identity of some input. Somewhat similar to
  zk-immediate-open.

The latest opened value will be stored in the contract state.
