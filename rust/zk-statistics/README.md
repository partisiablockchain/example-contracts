# Zero knowledge: Statistics

Smart contract where users can input secret data until a deadline, after which any user can
start a computation of statistics on the input data.

The user submitted data is an age group from { 0-19, 20-39, 40-59, 60- },
a gender from { male, female, other } and a favorite color from { red, blue, green, yellow }.

The statistics computed are summations of each choice of each variable.
