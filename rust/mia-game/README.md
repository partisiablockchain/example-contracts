# Mia Gaming Contract


## Rules 
3 or more players, all start with 6 lives.

The complete order of rolls (from highest to lowest): 

21 (Mia), 31 (Little Mia), 66, 55, 44, 33, 22, 11, 65, 64, 63, 62, 61, 54, 53, 52, 51, 43, 42, 41, 32

### Order of actions

The first player rolls the dice and keeps their value concealed from the other players.

#### The player then has three choices: 
* Tell the truth and announce what has been rolled.
* Lie and announce a greater value than that rolled.
* Lie and announce a lesser value.

The concealed dice are then passed to the next player in a clockwise fashion. 

#### The receiving player now has two options:
* Believe the passer, roll the dice and pass it on, announcing a higher valueâ€”with or without looking at them.
* Call the passer a liar and look at the dice. 
If the dice show a lesser value than that announced, the passer loses a life and the receiving player starts a new round.
However, if the dice show a greater or equal value, the current player loses a life and the next player starts a new round.

**Note:**
Each player must always announce a value greater than or equal to the previous value announced.

##### Mia announced
If Mia is announced, the next player has two choices:

* They may give up without looking at the dice and lose one life.
* They may look at the dice. If it was a Mia, they lose two lives. 
If it wasn't, the previous player loses two lives.


### Winning the game

Last remaining player is the winner.
